# python-chat-microservice-architecture
This is a project for clone social media **CRUD** functionalities using the **microservice architecture**.
The project uses **Django and Flask** each with different **databases and communicating through RABBITMQ messaging broker**.
For ease of communication I have optimized the power of **docker to containerize the backend microservices**.
Feel free to collaborate.**HAPPY CODDING**
